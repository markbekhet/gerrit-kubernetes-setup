This project is to create a local gerrit environment using kubernetes for scaling gerrit application.

Kubernetes is an orchestration tool that let the user scale the application and configure as many pods for replication purposes.

This insures the high-availability of the application.

Kubernetes can autorestart the pods automatically which allows the application to be available almost all the time.
